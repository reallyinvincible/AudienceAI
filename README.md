# AudienceAI
AudienceAI is a tool meant for workshop speakers, teachers and professors to analyze the emotions of the students during their teaching sessions. The user has to keep a camera recording the audience, after which, they will upload their video to our app. Our software extracts the emotions of each face in these video frames and generates emotion scores of all the students in each frame. These scores can then be visualized in the app to understand the reaction to the session.  Technology:  We built our app on Android and the backend is based on Go and Flask. We are running our deep learning models to extract faces and emotions using Tensorflow. The Go and Flask servers are running on an Azure NC6 Promo VM. Our UI was built using Adobe XD.
